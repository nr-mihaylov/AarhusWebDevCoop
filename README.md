# Mandatory Assignment: Umbraco
Group sizes: Individual or groups of max 2.


The project should be a Umbraco solution for the Aarhus Web Developers Network and must include the following areas:


- About page (3 columns grid layout must be used!) with 3 sections (vision, people, skills) with  info on the network.
- Home Section - you decide what to include, but there should be a list of the two newest projects at least included on this page.
- Article Section and of course some articles created.
- Project Section (info about projects, status, list of project sorted by date - newest first) and some projects in the content. The project list should only be viewable by active members, if you are a prospect member, you should get shown a “forbidden access” page. If you are not logged in, you should be referred to the login form.
- Contact Section, a form that must be interactive and save new comments in Umbraco backoffice(creating new contents) (to send email is optional)). There must be server side validation included in the contact form (i.e. fields should not be empty, this should give a message to the user and the email should be checked (this can easily be done!))
- Member Section - with a list of all the members (the list should only be viewable if you are a member that is logged in). You should have two member groups (active and prospect). You must show membership photos of active members.
- Message board section - here it should be possible to post messages that will be shown on this page giving two inputs (a name and a message). You can see one of the week plans for this exercise. You MUST put access restriction on this page, so that only members (both active and prospects) can post messages. 
- Login Section, a form where members can log in and there must also be an option to logout.
- A project drop-down menu where each project can be selected (see the navigation bar below). ONLY completed projects should be shown in the drop down and not all projects.
- A navigational bar from where all areas are easily accessed. With bootstrap it could look something like the image here (message board not shown in this menu - but you should include in the main menu)
